# GAN Networks

## Overview
Implementation of GAN Neural Netwok using PyTorch.

At the moment, only the Vanilla GAN is implemented and can be launched. It uses
the MNIST dataset (dowloaded directly from PyTorch datasets) to train and generate
number picture. Those images can be seen in `src/img/` while the network is training.

## Run programs
In order to run the training of our network, just type the following command in your terminal and you will see logs about how the training is going :
```bash
cd src
python3 main.py
```
